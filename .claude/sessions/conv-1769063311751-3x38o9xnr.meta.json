Open in Obsidian (Optional but Recommended)\n\n- Download [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md)\n- Open vault from the claudesidian folder\n- This gives you a visual interface alongside Claude Code\n\n### 4. Your First Session\n\nTell Claude Code:\n\n```\nI'm starting a new project about [topic].\nI'm in thinking mode, not writing mode.\nPlease search my vault for any relevant existing notes,\nthen help me explore this topic by asking questions.\n```\n\nOr use one of the pre-configured commands (in Claude Code):\n\n```\n/thinking-partner   # For collaborative exploration\n/daily-review       # For end-of-day reflection\n/research-assistant # For deep dives into topics\n```\n\n## Folder Structure\n\n```\nclaudesidian/\n├── 00_Inbox/           # Temporary capture point for new ideas\n├── 01_Projects/        # Active, time-bound initiatives\n├── 02_Areas/           # Ongoing responsibilities\n├── 03_Resources/       # Reference materials and knowledge base\n├── 04_Archive/         # Completed projects and inactive items\n├── 05_Attachments/     # Images, PDFs, and other files\n├── 06_Metadata/        # Vault configuration and templates\n│   ├── Reference/      # Documentation and guides\n│   └── Templates/      # Reusable note templates\n└── .scripts/           # Helper scripts for automation\n```\n\n## Key Concepts\n\n### Thinking Mode vs Writing Mode\n\n**Thinking Mode** (Research & Exploration):\n\n- Claude asks questions to understand your goals\n- Searches existing notes for relevant content\n- Helps make connections between ideas\n- Maintains a log of insights and progress\n\n**Writing Mode** (Content Creation):\n\n- Generates drafts based on your research\n- Helps structure and edit content\n- Creates final deliverables\n\n### The PARA Method\n\n**Projects**: Have a deadline and specific outcome\n\n- Example: \"Q4 2025 Marketing Strategy\"\n- Create a folder in `01_Projects/`\n\n**Areas**: Ongoing without an end date\n\n- Example: \"Health\", \"Finances\", \"Team Management\"\n- Lives in `02_Areas/`\n\n**Resources**: Topics of ongoing interest\n\n- Example: \"AI Research\", \"Writing Tips\"\n- Store in `03_Resources/`\n\n**Archive**: Inactive items\n\n- Completed projects with their outputs\n- Old notes no longer relevant\n\n## Claude Code Commands\n\nPre-configured AI assistants ready to use:\n\n- `thinking-partner` - Explore ideas through questions\n- `inbox-processor` - Organize your captures\n- `research-assistant` - Deep dive into topics\n- `daily-review` - End of day reflection\n- `weekly-synthesis` - Find patterns in your week\n- `create-command` - Build new custom commands\n- `de-ai-ify` - Remove AI writing patterns from text\n- `upgrade` - Update to the latest claudesidian version\n- `init-bootstrap` - Re-run the setup wizard\n- `install-claudesidian-command` - Install shell command to launch vault from\n  anywhere\n\nRun with: `/[command-name]` in Claude Code\n\n### Staying Updated with `/upgrade`\n\nClaudesidian automatically checks for updates when you start Claude Code and\nwill remind you to run `/upgrade` when new features are available.\n\nThe upgrade command intelligently merges new features while preserving your\ncustomizations:\n\n```bash\n# Preview what would be updated (recommended first)\n/upgrade check\n\n# Run the interactive upgrade\n/upgrade\n\n# Skip confirmations for safe updates (advanced)\n/upgrade force\n```\n\n**What the upgrade does:**\n\n- Creates a timestamped backup before making any changes\n- Shows you diffs for each file before updating\n- Preserves your personal notes and customizations\n- Only updates system files (commands, agents, scripts)\n- Never touches your content folders (00_Inbox, 01_Projects, etc.)\n- Provides rollback capability if needed\n\n**Safety features:**\n\n- All your personal content is protected\n- Complete backup created in `.backup/upgrade-[timestamp]/`\n- File-by-file review and confirmation\n- Progress tracked in `.upgrade-checklist.md`\n- Can be stopped and resumed at any time\n\n## Vision & Document Analysis (Optional)\n\nWith [Google Gemini](https://ai.google.dev/) MCP configured, Claude Code can\nprocess your attachments directly without having to describe them. This means:\n\n- **Direct image analysis**: Claude sees the actual image, not your description\n- **PDF text extraction**: Full document text without copy-pasting\n- **Bulk processing**: Analyze multiple screenshots or documents at once\n- **Smart organization**: Auto-generate filenames based on image content\n- **Comparison tasks**: Compare before/after screenshots, designs, etc.\n\n**Why this matters**: Instead of describing \"a screenshot showing an error\nmessage\", Claude Code directly sees and reads the error. Perfect for debugging\nUI issues, analyzing charts, or processing scanned documents.\n\n**Getting a Gemini API key:**\n\n1. Visit [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com)\n2. Sign in with your Google account\n3. Click \"Get API key\" in the left sidebar\n4. Create a new API key (it's free!)\n5. Set it in your environment: `export GEMINI_API_KEY=\"your-key-here\"`\n\nSee `.claude/mcp-servers/README.md` for full setup instructions\n\n## Web Research (Optional)\n\nWith [Firecrawl](https://www.firecrawl.dev/) configured, our helper scripts\nfetch and save full web content directly to your vault. This means:\n\n- **Full text capture**: Scripts pipe complete article text to files, not\n  summaries\n- **Context preservation**: Claude doesn't need to hold web content in memory\n- **Batch processing**: Save multiple articles at once with `firecrawl-batch.sh`\n- **Clean markdown**: Web pages converted to readable, searchable markdown\n- **Permanent archive**: Your research stays in your vault forever\n\n**Why this matters**: Instead of Claude reading a webpage and summarizing it\n(losing detail), the scripts save the FULL text. Claude can then search and\nanalyze thousands of saved articles without hitting context limits. Perfect for\nresearch projects, documentation archives, or building a knowledge base.\n\n**Example workflow:**\n\n```bash\n# Save a single article\nnpm run firecrawl:scrape -- \"https://example.com/article\" \"03_Resources/Articles\"\n\n# Batch save multiple URLs\nnpm run firecrawl:batch -- urls.txt \"03_Resources/Research\"\n```\n\n**Getting a Firecrawl API key:**\n\n1. Visit [Firecrawl](https://www.firecrawl.dev) and sign up\n2. Get 300 free credits to start (open-source, can self-host)\n3. Go to your dashboard to find your API key\n4. Copy the key (format: `fc-xxxxx...`)\n5. Set it in your environment: `export FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=\"fc-your-key-here\"`\n\n## Helper Scripts\n\nRun these with `pnpm`:\n\n- `attachments:list` - Show unprocessed attachments\n- `attachments:organized` - Count organized files\n- `attachments:sizes` - Find large files\n- `attachments:orphans` - Find unreferenced attachments\n- `vault:stats` - Show vault statistics\n\n## Advanced Setup\n\n### Quick Launch from Anywhere\n\nInstall a shell command to launch your vault from any directory:\n\n```bash\n# In Claude Code, run:\n/install-claudesidian-command\n```\n\nThis creates a `claudesidian` alias that:\n\n- Changes to your vault directory automatically\n- Tries to resume your existing session (if one exists)\n- Falls back to starting a new session\n- Returns to your original directory when done\n\n**Usage:**\n\n```bash\n# From anywhere in your terminal:\nclaudesidian\n\n# It will automatically resume your last session or start a new one\n```\n\nThe command is added to your shell config (~/.zshrc, ~/.bashrc, etc.) so it\npersists across terminal sessions.\n\n### Git Integration\n\nInitialize Git for version control:\n\n```bash\ngit init\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"Initial vault setup\"\ngit remote add origin your-repo-url\ngit push -u origin main\n```\n\nBest practices:\n\n- Commit after each work session\n- Use descriptive commit messages\n- Pull before starting work\n\n### Mobile Access\n\n1. Set up a small server (mini PC, cloud VPS, or home server)\n2. Install Tailscale for secure VPN access\n3. Clone your vault to the server\n4. Use Termius or similar SSH client on mobile\n5. Run Claude Code remotely\n\n### Custom Commands\n\nCreate specialized commands by saving instructions in `.claude/commands/`:\n\n**Research Assistant** (`06_Metadata/Agents/research-assistant.md`):\n\n```markdown\nYou are a research assistant.\n\n- Search the vault for relevant information\n- Synthesize findings from multiple sources\n- Identify gaps in knowledge\n- Suggest areas for further exploration\n```\n\n## Tips & Best Practices\n\n### From Experience\n\n1. **Start in thinking mode**: Resist the urge to generate content immediately\n2. **Be a token maximalist**: More context = better results\n3. **Save everything**: Capture chats, fragments, partial thoughts\n4. **Trust but verify**: Always read AI-generated content\n5. **Break your flow**: AI helps you resume easily\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Claude Code can't find my notes\n\n- Make sure you're running Claude Code from the vault root directory\n- Check file permissions\n- Verify markdown files have `.md` extension\n\n### Git conflicts\n\n- Always pull before starting work\n- Commit frequently with clear messages\n- Use branches for experimental changes\n\n### Attachment management\n\n- Run `npm run attachments:create-organized` to set up folders\n- Use helper scripts to find orphaned files\n- Keep attachments under 10MB for Git\n\n## Philosophy\n\nThis setup is based on key principles:\n\n1. **AI amplifies thinking, not just writing**\n2. **Local files = full control**\n3. **Structure enables creativity**\n4. **Iteration beats perfection**\n5. **The goal is insight, not just information**\n\n## Contributing\n\nWe welcome contributions from the community! This is a living template that gets\nbetter with everyone's input.\n\n### How to Contribute\n\n1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub\n2. **Create a feature branch** (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)\n3. **Make your changes**\n4. **Test your changes** to ensure everything works\n5. **Commit your changes** (`git commit -m 'Add amazing feature'`)\n6. **Push to the branch** (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)\n7. **Open a Pull Request** with a clear description of what you've done\n\n### What We're Looking For\n\n- **New commands**: Useful Claude Code commands for common workflows\n- **New agents**: Specialized agents for specific tasks\n- **Documentation improvements**: Better explanations, examples, or guides\n- **Bug fixes**: Found something broken?

Open in Obsidian (Optional but Recommended)\n\n- Download [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md)\n- Open vault from the claudesidian folder\n- This gives you a visual interface alongside Claude Code\n\n### 4. Your First Session\n\nTell Claude Code:\n\n```\nI'm starting a new project about [topic].\nI'm in thinking mode, not writing mode.\nPlease search my vault for any relevant existing notes,\nthen help me explore this topic by asking questions.\n```\n\nOr use one of the pre-configured commands (in Claude Code):\n\n```\n/thinking-partner   # For collaborative exploration\n/daily-review       # For end-of-day reflection\n/research-assistant # For deep dives into topics\n```\n\n## Folder Structure\n\n```\nclaudesidian/\n├── 00_收件箱/           # 临时捕获新想法的地方\n├── 01_项目/            # 活跃的、有时限的计划\n├── 02_领域/            # 持续进行的责任\n├── 03_资源/            # 参考资料和知识库\n├── 04_归档/            # 已完成的项目和非活跃项目\n├── 05_附件/            # 图片、PDF 和其他文件\n├── 06_元数据/          # Vault 配置和模板\n│   ├── 参考/           # 文档和指南\n│   └── 模板/           # 可重用的笔记模板\n└── .scripts/           # 自动化辅助脚本\n```\n\n## Key Concepts\n\n### Thinking Mode vs Writing Mode\n\n**Thinking Mode** (Research & Exploration):\n\n- Claude asks questions to understand your goals\n- Searches existing notes for relevant content\n- Helps make connections between ideas\n- Maintains a log of insights and progress\n\n**Writing Mode** (Content Creation):\n\n- Generates drafts based on your research\n- Helps structure and edit content\n- Creates final deliverables\n\n### The PARA Method\n\n**Projects**: Have a deadline and specific outcome\n\n- Example: \"Q4 2025 Marketing Strategy\"\n- Create a folder in `01_Projects/`\n\n**Areas**: Ongoing without an end date\n\n- Example: \"Health\", \"Finances\", \"Team Management\"\n- Lives in `02_Areas/`\n\n**Resources**: Topics of ongoing interest\n\n- Example: \"AI Research\", \"Writing Tips\"\n- Store in `03_Resources/`\n\n**Archive**: Inactive items\n\n- Completed projects with their outputs\n- Old notes no longer relevant\n\n## Claude Code Commands\n\nPre-configured AI assistants ready to use:\n\n- `thinking-partner` - Explore ideas through questions\n- `inbox-processor` - Organize your captures\n- `research-assistant` - Deep dive into topics\n- `daily-review` - End of day reflection\n- `weekly-synthesis` - Find patterns in your week\n- `create-command` - Build new custom commands\n- `de-ai-ify` - Remove AI writing patterns from text\n- `upgrade` - Update to the latest claudesidian version\n- `init-bootstrap` - Re-run the setup wizard\n- `install-claudesidian-command` - Install shell command to launch vault from\n  anywhere\n\nRun with: `/[command-name]` in Claude Code\n\n### Staying Updated with `/upgrade`\n\nClaudesidian automatically checks for updates when you start Claude Code and\nwill remind you to run `/upgrade` when new features are available.\n\nThe upgrade command intelligently merges new features while preserving your\ncustomizations:\n\n```bash\n# Preview what would be updated (recommended first)\n/upgrade check\n\n# Run the interactive upgrade\n/upgrade\n\n# Skip confirmations for safe updates (advanced)\n/upgrade force\n```\n\n**What the upgrade does:**\n\n- Creates a timestamped backup before making any changes\n- Shows you diffs for each file before updating\n- Preserves your personal notes and customizations\n- Only updates system files (commands, agents, scripts)\n- Never touches your content folders (00_Inbox, 01_Projects, etc.)\n- Provides rollback capability if needed\n\n**Safety features:**\n\n- All your personal content is protected\n- Complete backup created in `.backup/upgrade-[timestamp]/`\n- File-by-file review and confirmation\n- Progress tracked in `.upgrade-checklist.md`\n- Can be stopped and resumed at any time\n\n## Vision & Document Analysis (Optional)\n\nWith [Google Gemini](https://ai.google.dev/) MCP configured, Claude Code can\nprocess your attachments directly without having to describe them. This means:\n\n- **Direct image analysis**: Claude sees the actual image, not your description\n- **PDF text extraction**: Full document text without copy-pasting\n- **Bulk processing**: Analyze multiple screenshots or documents at once\n- **Smart organization**: Auto-generate filenames based on image content\n- **Comparison tasks**: Compare before/after screenshots, designs, etc.\n\n**Why this matters**: Instead of describing \"a screenshot showing an error\nmessage\", Claude Code directly sees and reads the error. Perfect for debugging\nUI issues, analyzing charts, or processing scanned documents.\n\n**Getting a Gemini API key:**\n\n1. Visit [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com)\n2. Sign in with your Google account\n3. Click \"Get API key\" in the left sidebar\n4. Create a new API key (it's free!)\n5. Set it in your environment: `export GEMINI_API_KEY=\"your-key-here\"`\n\nSee `.claude/mcp-servers/README.md` for full setup instructions\n\n## Web Research (Optional)\n\nWith [Firecrawl](https://www.firecrawl.dev/) configured, our helper scripts\nfetch and save full web content directly to your vault. This means:\n\n- **Full text capture**: Scripts pipe complete article text to files, not\n  summaries\n- **Context preservation**: Claude doesn't need to hold web content in memory\n- **Batch processing**: Save multiple articles at once with `firecrawl-batch.sh`\n- **Clean markdown**: Web pages converted to readable, searchable markdown\n- **Permanent archive**: Your research stays in your vault forever\n\n**Why this matters**: Instead of Claude reading a webpage and summarizing it\n(losing detail), the scripts save the FULL text. Claude can then search and\nanalyze thousands of saved articles without hitting context limits. Perfect for\nresearch projects, documentation archives, or building a knowledge base.\n\n**Example workflow:**\n\n```bash\n# Save a single article\nnpm run firecrawl:scrape -- \"https://example.com/article\" \"03_Resources/Articles\"\n\n# Batch save multiple URLs\nnpm run firecrawl:batch -- urls.txt \"03_Resources/Research\"\n```\n\n**Getting a Firecrawl API key:**\n\n1. Visit [Firecrawl](https://www.firecrawl.dev) and sign up\n2. Get 300 free credits to start (open-source, can self-host)\n3. Go to your dashboard to find your API key\n4. Copy the key (format: `fc-xxxxx...`)\n5. Set it in your environment: `export FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=\"fc-your-key-here\"`\n\n## Helper Scripts\n\nRun these with `pnpm`:\n\n- `attachments:list` - Show unprocessed attachments\n- `attachments:organized` - Count organized files\n- `attachments:sizes` - Find large files\n- `attachments:orphans` - Find unreferenced attachments\n- `vault:stats` - Show vault statistics\n\n## Advanced Setup\n\n### Quick Launch from Anywhere\n\nInstall a shell command to launch your vault from any directory:\n\n```bash\n# In Claude Code, run:\n/install-claudesidian-command\n```\n\nThis creates a `claudesidian` alias that:\n\n- Changes to your vault directory automatically\n- Tries to resume your existing session (if one exists)\n- Falls back to starting a new session\n- Returns to your original directory when done\n\n**Usage:**\n\n```bash\n# From anywhere in your terminal:\nclaudesidian\n\n# It will automatically resume your last session or start a new one\n```\n\nThe command is added to your shell config (~/.zshrc, ~/.bashrc, etc.) so it\npersists across terminal sessions.\n\n### Git Integration\n\nInitialize Git for version control:\n\n```bash\ngit init\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"Initial vault setup\"\ngit remote add origin your-repo-url\ngit push -u origin main\n```\n\nBest practices:\n\n- Commit after each work session\n- Use descriptive commit messages\n- Pull before starting work\n\n### Mobile Access\n\n1. Set up a small server (mini PC, cloud VPS, or home server)\n2. Install Tailscale for secure VPN access\n3. Clone your vault to the server\n4. Use Termius or similar SSH client on mobile\n5. Run Claude Code remotely\n\n### Custom Commands\n\nCreate specialized commands by saving instructions in `.claude/commands/`:\n\n**Research Assistant** (`06_Metadata/Agents/research-assistant.md`):\n\n```markdown\nYou are a research assistant.\n\n- Search the vault for relevant information\n- Synthesize findings from multiple sources\n- Identify gaps in knowledge\n- Suggest areas for further exploration\n```\n\n## Tips & Best Practices\n\n### From Experience\n\n1. **Start in thinking mode**: Resist the urge to generate content immediately\n2. **Be a token maximalist**: More context = better results\n3. **Save everything**: Capture chats, fragments, partial thoughts\n4. **Trust but verify**: Always read AI-generated content\n5. **Break your flow**: AI helps you resume easily\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Claude Code can't find my notes\n\n- Make sure you're running Claude Code from the vault root directory\n- Check file permissions\n- Verify markdown files have `.md` extension\n\n### Git conflicts\n\n- Always pull before starting work\n- Commit frequently with clear messages\n- Use branches for experimental changes\n\n### Attachment management\n\n- Run `npm run attachments:create-organized` to set up folders\n- Use helper scripts to find orphaned files\n- Keep attachments under 10MB for Git\n\n## Philosophy\n\nThis setup is based on key principles:\n\n1. **AI amplifies thinking, not just writing**\n2. **Local files = full control**\n3. **Structure enables creativity**\n4. **Iteration beats perfection**\n5. **The goal is insight, not just information**\n\n## Contributing\n\nWe welcome contributions from the community!

Your First Session\n\nTell Claude Code:\n\n```\nI'm starting a new project about [topic].\nI'm in thinking mode, not writing mode.\nPlease search my vault for any relevant existing notes,\nthen help me explore this topic by asking questions.\n```\n\nOr use one of the pre-configured commands (in Claude Code):\n\n```\n/thinking-partner   # For collaborative exploration\n/daily-review       # For end-of-day reflection\n/research-assistant # For deep dives into topics\n```\n\n## Folder Structure\n\n```\nclaudesidian/\n├── 00_收件箱/           # 临时捕获新想法的地方\n├── 01_项目/            # 活跃的、有时限的计划\n├── 02_领域/            # 持续进行的责任\n├── 03_资源/            # 参考资料和知识库\n├── 04_归档/            # 已完成的项目和非活跃项目\n├── 05_附件/            # 图片、PDF 和其他文件\n├── 06_元数据/          # Vault 配置和模板\n│   ├── 参考/           # 文档和指南\n│   └── 模板/           # 可重用的笔记模板\n└── .scripts/           # 自动化辅助脚本\n```\n\n## Key Concepts\n\n### Thinking Mode vs Writing Mode\n\n**Thinking Mode** (Research & Exploration):\n\n- Claude asks questions to understand your goals\n- Searches existing notes for relevant content\n- Helps make connections between ideas\n- Maintains a log of insights and progress\n\n**Writing Mode** (Content Creation):\n\n- Generates drafts based on your research\n- Helps structure and edit content\n- Creates final deliverables\n\n### The PARA Method\n\n**项目 (Projects)**: 有截止日期和明确成果\n\n- 例如：\"2025年Q4营销策略\"\n- 在 `01_项目/` 中创建文件夹\n\n**领域 (Areas)**: 持续进行，没有结束日期\n\n- 例如：\"健康\"、\"财务\"、\"团队管理\"\n- 存放在 `02_领域/`\n\n**资源 (Resources)**: 持续关注的主题\n\n- 例如：\"AI 研究\"、\"写作技巧\"\n- 存储在 `03_资源/`\n\n**Archive**: Inactive items\n\n- Completed projects with their outputs\n- Old notes no longer relevant\n\n## Claude Code Commands\n\nPre-configured AI assistants ready to use:\n\n- `thinking-partner` - Explore ideas through questions\n- `inbox-processor` - Organize your captures\n- `research-assistant` - Deep dive into topics\n- `daily-review` - End of day reflection\n- `weekly-synthesis` - Find patterns in your week\n- `create-command` - Build new custom commands\n- `de-ai-ify` - Remove AI writing patterns from text\n- `upgrade` - Update to the latest claudesidian version\n- `init-bootstrap` - Re-run the setup wizard\n- `install-claudesidian-command` - Install shell command to launch vault from\n  anywhere\n\nRun with: `/[command-name]` in Claude Code\n\n### Staying Updated with `/upgrade`\n\nClaudesidian automatically checks for updates when you start Claude Code and\nwill remind you to run `/upgrade` when new features are available.\n\nThe upgrade command intelligently merges new features while preserving your\ncustomizations:\n\n```bash\n# Preview what would be updated (recommended first)\n/upgrade check\n\n# Run the interactive upgrade\n/upgrade\n\n# Skip confirmations for safe updates (advanced)\n/upgrade force\n```\n\n**What the upgrade does:**\n\n- Creates a timestamped backup before making any changes\n- Shows you diffs for each file before updating\n- Preserves your personal notes and customizations\n- Only updates system files (commands, agents, scripts)\n- Never touches your content folders (00_Inbox, 01_Projects, etc.)\n- Provides rollback capability if needed\n\n**Safety features:**\n\n- All your personal content is protected\n- Complete backup created in `.backup/upgrade-[timestamp]/`\n- File-by-file review and confirmation\n- Progress tracked in `.upgrade-checklist.md`\n- Can be stopped and resumed at any time\n\n## Vision & Document Analysis (Optional)\n\nWith [Google Gemini](https://ai.google.dev/) MCP configured, Claude Code can\nprocess your attachments directly without having to describe them. This means:\n\n- **Direct image analysis**: Claude sees the actual image, not your description\n- **PDF text extraction**: Full document text without copy-pasting\n- **Bulk processing**: Analyze multiple screenshots or documents at once\n- **Smart organization**: Auto-generate filenames based on image content\n- **Comparison tasks**: Compare before/after screenshots, designs, etc.\n\n**Why this matters**: Instead of describing \"a screenshot showing an error\nmessage\", Claude Code directly sees and reads the error. Perfect for debugging\nUI issues, analyzing charts, or processing scanned documents.\n\n**Getting a Gemini API key:**\n\n1. Visit [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com)\n2. Sign in with your Google account\n3. Click \"Get API key\" in the left sidebar\n4. Create a new API key (it's free!)\n5. Set it in your environment: `export GEMINI_API_KEY=\"your-key-here\"`\n\nSee `.claude/mcp-servers/README.md` for full setup instructions\n\n## Web Research (Optional)\n\nWith [Firecrawl](https://www.firecrawl.dev/) configured, our helper scripts\nfetch and save full web content directly to your vault. This means:\n\n- **Full text capture**: Scripts pipe complete article text to files, not\n  summaries\n- **Context preservation**: Claude doesn't need to hold web content in memory\n- **Batch processing**: Save multiple articles at once with `firecrawl-batch.sh`\n- **Clean markdown**: Web pages converted to readable, searchable markdown\n- **Permanent archive**: Your research stays in your vault forever\n\n**Why this matters**: Instead of Claude reading a webpage and summarizing it\n(losing detail), the scripts save the FULL text. Claude can then search and\nanalyze thousands of saved articles without hitting context limits. Perfect for\nresearch projects, documentation archives, or building a knowledge base.\n\n**Example workflow:**\n\n```bash\n# Save a single article\nnpm run firecrawl:scrape -- \"https://example.com/article\" \"03_Resources/Articles\"\n\n# Batch save multiple URLs\nnpm run firecrawl:batch -- urls.txt \"03_Resources/Research\"\n```\n\n**Getting a Firecrawl API key:**\n\n1. Visit [Firecrawl](https://www.firecrawl.dev) and sign up\n2. Get 300 free credits to start (open-source, can self-host)\n3. Go to your dashboard to find your API key\n4.

Your First Session\n\nTell Claude Code:\n\n```\nI'm starting a new project about [topic].\nI'm in thinking mode, not writing mode.\nPlease search my vault for any relevant existing notes,\nthen help me explore this topic by asking questions.\n```\n\nOr use one of the pre-configured commands (in Claude Code):\n\n```\n/thinking-partner   # For collaborative exploration\n/daily-review       # For end-of-day reflection\n/research-assistant # For deep dives into topics\n```\n\n## Folder Structure\n\n```\nclaudesidian/\n├── 00_收件箱/           # 临时捕获新想法的地方\n├── 01_项目/            # 活跃的、有时限的计划\n├── 02_领域/            # 持续进行的责任\n├── 03_资源/            # 参考资料和知识库\n├── 04_归档/            # 已完成的项目和非活跃项目\n├── 05_附件/            # 图片、PDF 和其他文件\n├── 06_元数据/          # Vault 配置和模板\n│   ├── 参考/           # 文档和指南\n│   └── 模板/           # 可重用的笔记模板\n└── .scripts/           # 自动化辅助脚本\n```\n\n## Key Concepts\n\n### Thinking Mode vs Writing Mode\n\n**Thinking Mode** (Research & Exploration):\n\n- Claude asks questions to understand your goals\n- Searches existing notes for relevant content\n- Helps make connections between ideas\n- Maintains a log of insights and progress\n\n**Writing Mode** (Content Creation):\n\n- Generates drafts based on your research\n- Helps structure and edit content\n- Creates final deliverables\n\n### The PARA Method\n\n**项目 (Projects)**: 有截止日期和明确成果\n\n- 例如：\"2025年Q4营销策略\"\n- 在 `01_项目/` 中创建文件夹\n\n**领域 (Areas)**: 持续进行，没有结束日期\n\n- 例如：\"健康\"、\"财务\"、\"团队管理\"\n- 存放在 `02_领域/`\n\n**资源 (Resources)**: 持续关注的主题\n\n- 例如：\"AI 研究\"、\"写作技巧\"\n- 存储在 `03_资源/`\n\n**Archive**: Inactive items\n\n- Completed projects with their outputs\n- Old notes no longer relevant\n\n## Claude Code Commands\n\nPre-configured AI assistants ready to use:\n\n- `thinking-partner` - Explore ideas through questions\n- `inbox-processor` - Organize your captures\n- `research-assistant` - Deep dive into topics\n- `daily-review` - End of day reflection\n- `weekly-synthesis` - Find patterns in your week\n- `create-command` - Build new custom commands\n- `de-ai-ify` - Remove AI writing patterns from text\n- `upgrade` - Update to the latest claudesidian version\n- `init-bootstrap` - Re-run the setup wizard\n- `install-claudesidian-command` - Install shell command to launch vault from\n  anywhere\n\nRun with: `/[command-name]` in Claude Code\n\n### Staying Updated with `/upgrade`\n\nClaudesidian automatically checks for updates when you start Claude Code and\nwill remind you to run `/upgrade` when new features are available.\n\nThe upgrade command intelligently merges new features while preserving your\ncustomizations:\n\n```bash\n# Preview what would be updated (recommended first)\n/upgrade check\n\n# Run the interactive upgrade\n/upgrade\n\n# Skip confirmations for safe updates (advanced)\n/upgrade force\n```\n\n**What the upgrade does:**\n\n- Creates a timestamped backup before making any changes\n- Shows you diffs for each file before updating\n- Preserves your personal notes and customizations\n- Only updates system files (commands, agents, scripts)\n- 永远不会触碰你的内容文件夹（00_收件箱、01_项目 等）\n- Provides rollback capability if needed\n\n**Safety features:**\n\n- All your personal content is protected\n- Complete backup created in `.backup/upgrade-[timestamp]/`\n- File-by-file review and confirmation\n- Progress tracked in `.upgrade-checklist.md`\n- Can be stopped and resumed at any time\n\n## Vision & Document Analysis (Optional)\n\nWith [Google Gemini](https://ai.google.dev/) MCP configured, Claude Code can\nprocess your attachments directly without having to describe them. This means:\n\n- **Direct image analysis**: Claude sees the actual image, not your description\n- **PDF text extraction**: Full document text without copy-pasting\n- **Bulk processing**: Analyze multiple screenshots or documents at once\n- **Smart organization**: Auto-generate filenames based on image content\n- **Comparison tasks**: Compare before/after screenshots, designs, etc.\n\n**Why this matters**: Instead of describing \"a screenshot showing an error\nmessage\", Claude Code directly sees and reads the error. Perfect for debugging\nUI issues, analyzing charts, or processing scanned documents.\n\n**Getting a Gemini API key:**\n\n1. Visit [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com)\n2. Sign in with your Google account\n3. Click \"Get API key\" in the left sidebar\n4. Create a new API key (it's free!)\n5. Set it in your environment: `export GEMINI_API_KEY=\"your-key-here\"`\n\nSee `.claude/mcp-servers/README.md` for full setup instructions\n\n## Web Research (Optional)\n\nWith [Firecrawl](https://www.firecrawl.dev/) configured, our helper scripts\nfetch and save full web content directly to your vault. This means:\n\n- **Full text capture**: Scripts pipe complete article text to files, not\n  summaries\n- **Context preservation**: Claude doesn't need to hold web content in memory\n- **Batch processing**: Save multiple articles at once with `firecrawl-batch.sh`\n- **Clean markdown**: Web pages converted to readable, searchable markdown\n- **Permanent archive**: Your research stays in your vault forever\n\n**Why this matters**: Instead of Claude reading a webpage and summarizing it\n(losing detail), the scripts save the FULL text. Claude can then search and\nanalyze thousands of saved articles without hitting context limits. Perfect for\nresearch projects, documentation archives, or building a knowledge base.\n\n**Example workflow:**\n\n```bash\n# Save a single article\nnpm run firecrawl:scrape -- \"https://example.com/article\" \"03_Resources/Articles\"\n\n# Batch save multiple URLs\nnpm run firecrawl:batch -- urls.txt \"03_Resources/Research\"\n```\n\n**Getting a Firecrawl API key:**\n\n1.

Claude can then search and\nanalyze thousands of saved articles without hitting context limits. Perfect for\nresearch projects, documentation archives, or building a knowledge base.\n\n**Example workflow:**\n\n```bash\n# 保存单篇文章\nnpm run firecrawl:scrape -- \"https://example.com/article\" \"03_资源/文章\"\n\n# 批量保存多个 URL\nnpm run firecrawl:batch -- urls.txt \"03_资源/研究\"\n```\n\n**Getting a Firecrawl API key:**\n\n1. Visit [Firecrawl](https://www.firecrawl.dev) and sign up\n2. Get 300 free credits to start (open-source, can self-host)\n3. Go to your dashboard to find your API key\n4. Copy the key (format: `fc-xxxxx...`)\n5. Set it in your environment: `export FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=\"fc-your-key-here\"`\n\n## Helper Scripts\n\nRun these with `pnpm`:\n\n- `attachments:list` - Show unprocessed attachments\n- `attachments:organized` - Count organized files\n- `attachments:sizes` - Find large files\n- `attachments:orphans` - Find unreferenced attachments\n- `vault:stats` - Show vault statistics\n\n## Advanced Setup\n\n### Quick Launch from Anywhere\n\nInstall a shell command to launch your vault from any directory:\n\n```bash\n# In Claude Code, run:\n/install-claudesidian-command\n```\n\nThis creates a `claudesidian` alias that:\n\n- Changes to your vault directory automatically\n- Tries to resume your existing session (if one exists)\n- Falls back to starting a new session\n- Returns to your original directory when done\n\n**Usage:**\n\n```bash\n# From anywhere in your terminal:\nclaudesidian\n\n# It will automatically resume your last session or start a new one\n```\n\nThe command is added to your shell config (~/.zshrc, ~/.bashrc, etc.) so it\npersists across terminal sessions.\n\n### Git Integration\n\nInitialize Git for version control:\n\n```bash\ngit init\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"Initial vault setup\"\ngit remote add origin your-repo-url\ngit push -u origin main\n```\n\nBest practices:\n\n- Commit after each work session\n- Use descriptive commit messages\n- Pull before starting work\n\n### Mobile Access\n\n1. Set up a small server (mini PC, cloud VPS, or home server)\n2. Install Tailscale for secure VPN access\n3. Clone your vault to the server\n4. Use Termius or similar SSH client on mobile\n5.

Sign in with your Google account\n3. Click \"Get API key\" in the left sidebar\n4. Create a new API key (it's free!)\n5. Set it in your environment: `export GEMINI_API_KEY=\"your-key-here\"`\n\nSee `.claude/mcp-servers/README.md` for full setup instructions\n\n## Web Research (Optional)\n\nWith [Firecrawl](https://www.firecrawl.dev/) configured, our helper scripts\nfetch and save full web content directly to your vault. This means:\n\n- **Full text capture**: Scripts pipe complete article text to files, not\n  summaries\n- **Context preservation**: Claude doesn't need to hold web content in memory\n- **Batch processing**: Save multiple articles at once with `firecrawl-batch.sh`\n- **Clean markdown**: Web pages converted to readable, searchable markdown\n- **Permanent archive**: Your research stays in your vault forever\n\n**Why this matters**: Instead of Claude reading a webpage and summarizing it\n(losing detail), the scripts save the FULL text. Claude can then search and\nanalyze thousands of saved articles without hitting context limits. Perfect for\nresearch projects, documentation archives, or building a knowledge base.\n\n**Example workflow:**\n\n```bash\n# 保存单篇文章\nnpm run firecrawl:scrape -- \"https://example.com/article\" \"03_资源/文章\"\n\n# 批量保存多个 URL\nnpm run firecrawl:batch -- urls.txt \"03_资源/研究\"\n```\n\n**Getting a Firecrawl API key:**\n\n1. Visit [Firecrawl](https://www.firecrawl.dev) and sign up\n2. Get 300 free credits to start (open-source, can self-host)\n3. Go to your dashboard to find your API key\n4. Copy the key (format: `fc-xxxxx...`)\n5. Set it in your environment: `export FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=\"fc-your-key-here\"`\n\n## Helper Scripts\n\nRun these with `pnpm`:\n\n- `attachments:list` - Show unprocessed attachments\n- `attachments:organized` - Count organized files\n- `attachments:sizes` - Find large files\n- `attachments:orphans` - Find unreferenced attachments\n- `vault:stats` - Show vault statistics\n\n## Advanced Setup\n\n### Quick Launch from Anywhere\n\nInstall a shell command to launch your vault from any directory:\n\n```bash\n# In Claude Code, run:\n/install-claudesidian-command\n```\n\nThis creates a `claudesidian` alias that:\n\n- Changes to your vault directory automatically\n- Tries to resume your existing session (if one exists)\n- Falls back to starting a new session\n- Returns to your original directory when done\n\n**Usage:**\n\n```bash\n# From anywhere in your terminal:\nclaudesidian\n\n# It will automatically resume your last session or start a new one\n```\n\nThe command is added to your shell config (~/.zshrc, ~/.bashrc, etc.) so it\npersists across terminal sessions.\n\n### Git Integration\n\nInitialize Git for version control:\n\n```bash\ngit init\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"Initial vault setup\"\ngit remote add origin your-repo-url\ngit push -u origin main\n```\n\nBest practices:\n\n- Commit after each work session\n- Use descriptive commit messages\n- Pull before starting work\n\n### Mobile Access\n\n1. Set up a small server (mini PC, cloud VPS, or home server)\n2. Install Tailscale for secure VPN access\n3. Clone your vault to the server\n4. Use Termius or similar SSH client on mobile\n5. Run Claude Code remotely\n\n### Custom Commands\n\nCreate specialized commands by saving instructions in `.claude/commands/`:\n\n**研究助手** (`06_元数据/Agents/research-assistant.md`):\n\n```markdown\nYou are a research assistant.\n\n- Search the vault for relevant information\n- Synthesize findings from multiple sources\n- Identify gaps in knowledge\n- Suggest areas for further exploration\n```\n\n## Tips & Best Practices\n\n### From Experience\n\n1. **Start in thinking mode**: Resist the urge to generate content immediately\n2. **Be a token maximalist**: More context = better results\n3. **Save everything**: Capture chats, fragments, partial thoughts\n4. **Trust but verify**: Always read AI-generated content\n5. **Break your flow**: AI helps you resume easily\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Claude Code can't find my notes\n\n- Make sure you're running Claude Code from the vault root directory\n- Check file permissions\n- Verify markdown files have `.md` extension\n\n### Git conflicts\n\n- Always pull before starting work\n- Commit frequently with clear messages\n- Use branches for experimental changes\n\n### Attachment management\n\n- Run `npm run attachments:create-organized` to set up folders\n- Use helper scripts to find orphaned files\n- Keep attachments under 10MB for Git\n\n## Philosophy\n\nThis setup is based on key principles:\n\n1. **AI amplifies thinking, not just writing**\n2. **Local files = full control**\n3. **Structure enables creativity**\n4. **Iteration beats perfection**\n5. **The goal is insight, not just information**\n\n## Contributing\n\nWe welcome contributions from the community! This is a living template that gets\nbetter with everyone's input.\n\n### How to Contribute\n\n1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub\n2. **Create a feature branch** (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)\n3. **Make your changes**\n4. **Test your changes** to ensure everything works\n5. **Commit your changes** (`git commit -m 'Add amazing feature'`)\n6. **Push to the branch** (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)\n7. **Open a Pull Request** with a clear description of what you've done\n\n### What We're Looking For\n\n- **New commands**: Useful Claude Code commands for common workflows\n- **New agents**: Specialized agents for specific tasks\n- **Documentation improvements**: Better explanations, examples, or guides\n- **Bug fixes**: Found something broken? Fix it!\n- **Workflow templates**: Share your productive workflows\n- **Helper scripts**: Automation tools that make vault management easier\n- **Integration guides**: Connect Claudesidian with other tools\n- **Core updates**: Improvements to the upgrade system, setup wizard, or other\n  core features\n\n### Guidelines\n\n- Keep commands focused and single-purpose\n- Write clear documentation with examples\n- Test thoroughly before submitting\n- Follow existing code style and structure\n- Update the CHANGELOG.md with your changes\n- **AI-generated content is welcome, but you MUST carefully read and review\n  everything before submitting** - never submit code you don't understand\n\n### Getting Updates\n\nWhen new features are contributed and merged, users can easily get them with:\n\n```bash\n/upgrade\n```\n\nThe upgrade command intelligently merges new features while preserving your\npersonal customizations, making it easy to benefit from community contributions\nwithout losing your work.\n\n### Questions or Ideas?\n\n- Open an issue to discuss major changes before starting work\n- Join discussions in existing issues\n- Share your use cases - they help us understand needs better\n\nRemember: best practices emerge from use, not theory. Your real-world experience\nmakes this better for everyone!\n\n## Resources\n\n- [Obsidian Documentation](https://help.obsidian.md)\n- [PARA Method](https://fortelabs.com/blog/para/)\n- [Claude Code Documentation](https://claude.ai/docs)\n\n## Inspiration\n\nThis starter kit was inspired by the workflows discussed in:\n\n- [How to Use Claude Code as a Second Brain](https://every.to/podcast/how-to-use-claude-code-as-a-thinking-partner) -\n  Noah Brier's interview with Dan Shipper\n- Built by the team at [Alephic](https://alephic.com) - an AI-first strategy and\n  software partner that helps organizations solve complex challenges through\n  custom AI systems\n\n## License\n\nMIT - Use this however you want.

      "originalContent": "# Scripts Directory\r\n\r\nHelper scripts for vault automation and web content capture.\r\n\r\n## Available Scripts\r\n\r\n### Attachment Management\r\n\r\nThese are primarily called via npm/pnpm commands in package.json:\r\n\r\n- `update-attachment-links.js` - Updates note links after moving attachments\r\n- `fix-renamed-links.js` - Fixes links after renaming files\r\n\r\n### Web Content Capture\r\n\r\n**Note**: These scripts require API keys to function:\r\n\r\n#### firecrawl-scrape.sh\r\n\r\nScrapes a single URL and saves as markdown.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# Requires FIRECRAWL_API_KEY environment variable\r\n.scripts/firecrawl-scrape.sh <url> <output_file>\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### firecrawl-batch.sh\r\n\r\nScrapes multiple URLs and auto-generates filenames.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# Requires FIRECRAWL_API_KEY environment variable\r\n\r\n# Basic usage - saves to 00_Inbox/Clippings/\r\n.scripts/firecrawl-batch.sh <url1> <url2> <url3>\r\n\r\n# Custom output directory\r\n.scripts/firecrawl-batch.sh -o 01_Projects/Research/ <url1> <url2>\r\n.scripts/firecrawl-batch.sh --output-dir 03_Resources/Articles/ <url1> <url2>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Transcript Extraction\r\n\r\n#### transcript-extract.sh\r\n\r\nExtracts transcripts from YouTube videos.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# Basic usage - saves to 00_Inbox/Clippings/\r\n.scripts/transcript-extract.sh <youtube-url>\r\n\r\n# Custom output directory\r\n.scripts/transcript-extract.sh <youtube-url> 01_Projects/Research/\r\n```\r\n\r\n## NPM Scripts\r\n\r\nRun these from the vault root with `pnpm`:\r\n\r\n| Command                        | Description                           |\r\n| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- |\r\n| `attachments:list`             | Show first 20 unprocessed attachments |\r\n| `attachments:count`            | Count unprocessed attachments         |\r\n| `attachments:organized`        | Count files in Organized folder       |\r\n| `attachments:unprocessed`      | Same as count                         |\r\n| `attachments:refs <file>`      | Find references to a specific file    |\r\n| `attachments:sizes`            | Show 20 largest attachment files      |\r\n| `attachments:orphans`          | Find unreferenced attachments         |\r\n| `attachments:recent`           | Show files added in last 7 days       |\r\n| `attachments:create-organized` | Create the Organized subfolder        |\r\n\r\n## Setup Requirements\r\n\r\n### For Web Scraping\r\n\r\n1. Get a Firecrawl API key from [firecrawl.dev](https://firecrawl.dev)\r\n2. Add to your shell profile:\r\n   ```bash\r\n   export FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=\"your-key-here\"\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n### For Transcript Extraction\r\n\r\n- Requires `yt-dlp` and `jq` installed:\r\n\r\n  ```bash\r\n  # macOS\r\n  brew install yt-dlp jq\r\n\r\n  # Linux\r\n  apt-get install yt-dlp jq\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n## Adding Custom Scripts\r\n\r\n1.

Your First Session\n\nTell Claude Code:\n\n```\nI'm starting a new project about [topic].\nI'm in thinking mode, not writing mode.\nPlease search my vault for any relevant existing notes,\nthen help me explore this topic by asking questions.\n```\n\nOr use one of the pre-configured commands (in Claude Code):\n\n```\n/thinking-partner   # For collaborative exploration\n/daily-review       # For end-of-day reflection\n/research-assistant # For deep dives into topics\n```\n\n## Folder Structure\n\n```\nclaudesidian/\n├── 00_收件箱/           # 临时捕获新想法的地方\n├── 01_项目/            # 活跃的、有时限的计划\n├── 02_领域/            # 持续进行的责任\n├── 03_资源/            # 参考资料和知识库\n├── 04_归档/            # 已完成的项目和非活跃项目\n├── 05_附件/            # 图片、PDF 和其他文件\n├── 06_元数据/          # Vault 配置和模板\n│   ├── 参考/           # 文档和指南\n│   └── 模板/           # 可重用的笔记模板\n└── .scripts/           # 自动化辅助脚本\n```\n\n## Key Concepts\n\n### Thinking Mode vs Writing Mode\n\n**Thinking Mode** (Research & Exploration):\n\n- Claude asks questions to understand your goals\n- Searches existing notes for relevant content\n- Helps make connections between ideas\n- Maintains a log of insights and progress\n\n**Writing Mode** (Content Creation):\n\n- Generates drafts based on your research\n- Helps structure and edit content\n- Creates final deliverables\n\n### The PARA Method\n\n**项目 (Projects)**: 有截止日期和明确成果\n\n- 例如：\"2025年Q4营销策略\"\n- 在 `01_项目/` 中创建文件夹\n\n**领域 (Areas)**: 持续进行，没有结束日期\n\n- 例如：\"健康\"、\"财务\"、\"团队管理\"\n- 存放在 `02_领域/`\n\n**资源 (Resources)**: 持续关注的主题\n\n- 例如：\"AI 研究\"、\"写作技巧\"\n- 存储在 `03_资源/`\n\n**Archive**: Inactive items\n\n- Completed projects with their outputs\n- Old notes no longer relevant\n\n## Claude Code Commands\n\nPre-configured AI assistants ready to use:\n\n- `thinking-partner` - Explore ideas through questions\n- `inbox-processor` - Organize your captures\n- `research-assistant` - Deep dive into topics\n- `daily-review` - End of day reflection\n- `weekly-synthesis` - Find patterns in your week\n- `create-command` - Build new custom commands\n- `de-ai-ify` - Remove AI writing patterns from text\n- `upgrade` - Update to the latest claudesidian version\n- `init-bootstrap` - Re-run the setup wizard\n- `install-claudesidian-command` - Install shell command to launch vault from\n  anywhere\n\nRun with: `/[command-name]` in Claude Code\n\n### Staying Updated with `/upgrade`\n\nClaudesidian automatically checks for updates when you start Claude Code and\nwill remind you to run `/upgrade` when new features are available.\n\nThe upgrade command intelligently merges new features while preserving your\ncustomizations:\n\n```bash\n# Preview what would be updated (recommended first)\n/upgrade check\n\n# Run the interactive upgrade\n/upgrade\n\n# Skip confirmations for safe updates (advanced)\n/upgrade force\n```\n\n**What the upgrade does:**\n\n- Creates a timestamped backup before making any changes\n- Shows you diffs for each file before updating\n- Preserves your personal notes and customizations\n- Only updates system files (commands, agents, scripts)\n- 永远不会触碰你的内容文件夹（00_收件箱、01_项目 等）\n- Provides rollback capability if needed\n\n**Safety features:**\n\n- All your personal content is protected\n- Complete backup created in `.backup/upgrade-[timestamp]/`\n- File-by-file review and confirmation\n- Progress tracked in `.upgrade-checklist.md`\n- Can be stopped and resumed at any time\n\n## Vision & Document Analysis (Optional)\n\nWith [Google Gemini](https://ai.google.dev/) MCP configured, Claude Code can\nprocess your attachments directly without having to describe them. This means:\n\n- **Direct image analysis**: Claude sees the actual image, not your description\n- **PDF text extraction**: Full document text without copy-pasting\n- **Bulk processing**: Analyze multiple screenshots or documents at once\n- **Smart organization**: Auto-generate filenames based on image content\n- **Comparison tasks**: Compare before/after screenshots, designs, etc.\n\n**Why this matters**: Instead of describing \"a screenshot showing an error\nmessage\", Claude Code directly sees and reads the error. Perfect for debugging\nUI issues, analyzing charts, or processing scanned documents.\n\n**Getting a Gemini API key:**\n\n1. Visit [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com)\n2. Sign in with your Google account\n3. Click \"Get API key\" in the left sidebar\n4. Create a new API key (it's free!)\n5. Set it in your environment: `export GEMINI_API_KEY=\"your-key-here\"`\n\nSee `.claude/mcp-servers/README.md` for full setup instructions\n\n## Web Research (Optional)\n\nWith [Firecrawl](https://www.firecrawl.dev/) configured, our helper scripts\nfetch and save full web content directly to your vault. This means:\n\n- **Full text capture**: Scripts pipe complete article text to files, not\n  summaries\n- **Context preservation**: Claude doesn't need to hold web content in memory\n- **Batch processing**: Save multiple articles at once with `firecrawl-batch.sh`\n- **Clean markdown**: Web pages converted to readable, searchable markdown\n- **Permanent archive**: Your research stays in your vault forever\n\n**Why this matters**: Instead of Claude reading a webpage and summarizing it\n(losing detail), the scripts save the FULL text. Claude can then search and\nanalyze thousands of saved articles without hitting context limits. Perfect for\nresearch projects, documentation archives, or building a knowledge base.\n\n**Example workflow:**\n\n```bash\n# 保存单篇文章\nnpm run firecrawl:scrape -- \"https://example.com/article\" \"03_资源/文章\"\n\n# 批量保存多个 URL\nnpm run firecrawl:batch -- urls.txt \"03_资源/研究\"\n```\n\n**Getting a Firecrawl API key:**\n\n1. Visit [Firecrawl](https://www.firecrawl.dev) and sign up\n2. Get 300 free credits to start (open-source, can self-host)\n3. Go to your dashboard to find your API key\n4. Copy the key (format: `fc-xxxxx...`)\n5. Set it in your environment: `export FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=\"fc-your-key-here\"`\n\n## Helper Scripts\n\nRun these with `pnpm`:\n\n- `attachments:list` - Show unprocessed attachments\n- `attachments:organized` - Count organized files\n- `attachments:sizes` - Find large files\n- `attachments:orphans` - Find unreferenced attachments\n- `vault:stats` - Show vault statistics\n\n## Advanced Setup\n\n### Quick Launch from Anywhere\n\nInstall a shell command to launch your vault from any directory:\n\n```bash\n# In Claude Code, run:\n/install-claudesidian-command\n```\n\nThis creates a `claudesidian` alias that:\n\n- Changes to your vault directory automatically\n- Tries to resume your existing session (if one exists)\n- Falls back to starting a new session\n- Returns to your original directory when done\n\n**Usage:**\n\n```bash\n# From anywhere in your terminal:\nclaudesidian\n\n# It will automatically resume your last session or start a new one\n```\n\nThe command is added to your shell config (~/.zshrc, ~/.bashrc, etc.) so it\npersists across terminal sessions.\n\n### Git Integration\n\nInitialize Git for version control:\n\n```bash\ngit init\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"Initial vault setup\"\ngit remote add origin your-repo-url\ngit push -u origin main\n```\n\nBest practices:\n\n- Commit after each work session\n- Use descriptive commit messages\n- Pull before starting work\n\n### Mobile Access\n\n1. Set up a small server (mini PC, cloud VPS, or home server)\n2. Install Tailscale for secure VPN access\n3. Clone your vault to the server\n4. Use Termius or similar SSH client on mobile\n5. Run Claude Code remotely\n\n### Custom Commands\n\nCreate specialized commands by saving instructions in `.claude/commands/`:\n\n**研究助手** (`06_元数据/代理/research-assistant.md`):\n\n```markdown\nYou are a research assistant.\n\n- Search the vault for relevant information\n- Synthesize findings from multiple sources\n- Identify gaps in knowledge\n- Suggest areas for further exploration\n```\n\n## Tips & Best Practices\n\n### From Experience\n\n1. **Start in thinking mode**: Resist the urge to generate content immediately\n2. **Be a token maximalist**: More context = better results\n3. **Save everything**: Capture chats, fragments, partial thoughts\n4. **Trust but verify**: Always read AI-generated content\n5. **Break your flow**: AI helps you resume easily\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Claude Code can't find my notes\n\n- Make sure you're running Claude Code from the vault root directory\n- Check file permissions\n- Verify markdown files have `.md` extension\n\n### Git conflicts\n\n- Always pull before starting work\n- Commit frequently with clear messages\n- Use branches for experimental changes\n\n### Attachment management\n\n- Run `npm run attachments:create-organized` to set up folders\n- Use helper scripts to find orphaned files\n- Keep attachments under 10MB for Git\n\n## Philosophy\n\nThis setup is based on key principles:\n\n1. **AI amplifies thinking, not just writing**\n2. **Local files = full control**\n3. **Structure enables creativity**\n4. **Iteration beats perfection**\n5. **The goal is insight, not just information**\n\n## Contributing\n\nWe welcome contributions from the community! This is a living template that gets\nbetter with everyone's input.\n\n### How to Contribute\n\n1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub\n2. **Create a feature branch** (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)\n3. **Make your changes**\n4. **Test your changes** to ensure everything works\n5. **Commit your changes** (`git commit -m 'Add amazing feature'`)\n6. **Push to the branch** (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)\n7. **Open a Pull Request** with a clear description of what you've done\n\n### What We're Looking For\n\n- **New commands**: Useful Claude Code commands for common workflows\n- **New agents**: Specialized agents for specific tasks\n- **Documentation improvements**: Better explanations, examples, or guides\n- **Bug fixes**: Found something broken? Fix it!\n- **Workflow templates**: Share your productive workflows\n- **Helper scripts**: Automation tools that make vault management easier\n- **Integration guides**: Connect Claudesidian with other tools\n- **Core updates**: Improvements to the upgrade system, setup wizard, or other\n  core features\n\n### Guidelines\n\n- Keep commands focused and single-purpose\n- Write clear documentation with examples\n- Test thoroughly before submitting\n- Follow existing code style and structure\n- Update the CHANGELOG.md with your changes\n- **AI-generated content is welcome, but you MUST carefully read and review\n  everything before submitting** - never submit code you don't understand\n\n### Getting Updates\n\nWhen new features are contributed and merged, users can easily get them with:\n\n```bash\n/upgrade\n```\n\nThe upgrade command intelligently merges new features while preserving your\npersonal customizations, making it easy to benefit from community contributions\nwithout losing your work.\n\n### Questions or Ideas?\n\n- Open an issue to discuss major changes before starting work\n- Join discussions in existing issues\n- Share your use cases - they help us understand needs better\n\nRemember: best practices emerge from use, not theory. Your real-world experience\nmakes this better for everyone!\n\n## Resources\n\n- [Obsidian Documentation](https://help.obsidian.md)\n- [PARA Method](https://fortelabs.com/blog/para/)\n- [Claude Code Documentation](https://claude.ai/docs)\n\n## Inspiration\n\nThis starter kit was inspired by the workflows discussed in:\n\n- [How to Use Claude Code as a Second Brain](https://every.to/podcast/how-to-use-claude-code-as-a-thinking-partner) -\n  Noah Brier's interview with Dan Shipper\n- Built by the team at [Alephic](https://alephic.com) - an AI-first strategy and\n  software partner that helps organizations solve complex challenges through\n  custom AI systems\n\n## License\n\nMIT - Use this however you want.

Set it in your environment: `export FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=\"fc-your-key-here\"`\n\n## Helper Scripts\n\nRun these with `pnpm`:\n\n- `attachments:list` - Show unprocessed attachments\n- `attachments:organized` - Count organized files\n- `attachments:sizes` - Find large files\n- `attachments:orphans` - Find unreferenced attachments\n- `vault:stats` - Show vault statistics\n\n## Advanced Setup\n\n### Quick Launch from Anywhere\n\nInstall a shell command to launch your vault from any directory:\n\n```bash\n# In Claude Code, run:\n/install-claudesidian-command\n```\n\nThis creates a `claudesidian` alias that:\n\n- Changes to your vault directory automatically\n- Tries to resume your existing session (if one exists)\n- Falls back to starting a new session\n- Returns to your original directory when done\n\n**Usage:**\n\n```bash\n# From anywhere in your terminal:\nclaudesidian\n\n# It will automatically resume your last session or start a new one\n```\n\nThe command is added to your shell config (~/.zshrc, ~/.bashrc, etc.) so it\npersists across terminal sessions.\n\n### Git Integration\n\nInitialize Git for version control:\n\n```bash\ngit init\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"Initial vault setup\"\ngit remote add origin your-repo-url\ngit push -u origin main\n```\n\nBest practices:\n\n- Commit after each work session\n- Use descriptive commit messages\n- Pull before starting work\n\n### Mobile Access\n\n1. Set up a small server (mini PC, cloud VPS, or home server)\n2. Install Tailscale for secure VPN access\n3. Clone your vault to the server\n4. Use Termius or similar SSH client on mobile\n5. Run Claude Code remotely\n\n### Custom Commands\n\nCreate specialized commands by saving instructions in `.claude/commands/`:\n\n**研究助手** (`06_元数据/代理/research-assistant.md`):\n\n```markdown\nYou are a research assistant.\n\n- Search the vault for relevant information\n- Synthesize findings from multiple sources\n- Identify gaps in knowledge\n- Suggest areas for further exploration\n```\n\n## Tips & Best Practices\n\n### From Experience\n\n1. **Start in thinking mode**: Resist the urge to generate content immediately\n2. **Be a token maximalist**: More context = better results\n3. **Save everything**: Capture chats, fragments, partial thoughts\n4. **Trust but verify**: Always read AI-generated content\n5. **Break your flow**: AI helps you resume easily\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Claude Code can't find my notes\n\n- Make sure you're running Claude Code from the vault root directory\n- Check file permissions\n- Verify markdown files have `.md` extension\n\n### Git conflicts\n\n- Always pull before starting work\n- Commit frequently with clear messages\n- Use branches for experimental changes\n\n### Attachment management\n\n- Run `npm run attachments:create-organized` to set up folders\n- Use helper scripts to find orphaned files\n- Keep attachments under 10MB for Git\n\n## Philosophy\n\nThis setup is based on key principles:\n\n1. **AI amplifies thinking, not just writing**\n2. **Local files = full control**\n3. **Structure enables creativity**\n4. **Iteration beats perfection**\n5. **The goal is insight, not just information**\n\n## Contributing\n\nWe welcome contributions from the community! This is a living template that gets\nbetter with everyone's input.\n\n### How to Contribute\n\n1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub\n2. **Create a feature branch** (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)\n3. **Make your changes**\n4. **Test your changes** to ensure everything works\n5. **Commit your changes** (`git commit -m 'Add amazing feature'`)\n6. **Push to the branch** (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)\n7. **Open a Pull Request** with a clear description of what you've done\n\n### What We're Looking For\n\n- **New commands**: Useful Claude Code commands for common workflows\n- **New agents**: Specialized agents for specific tasks\n- **Documentation improvements**: Better explanations, examples, or guides\n- **Bug fixes**: Found something broken? Fix it!\n- **Workflow templates**: Share your productive workflows\n- **Helper scripts**: Automation tools that make vault management easier\n- **Integration guides**: Connect Claudesidian with other tools\n- **Core updates**: Improvements to the upgrade system, setup wizard, or other\n  core features\n\n### Guidelines\n\n- Keep commands focused and single-purpose\n- Write clear documentation with examples\n- Test thoroughly before submitting\n- Follow existing code style and structure\n- Update the CHANGELOG.md with your changes\n- **AI-generated content is welcome, but you MUST carefully read and review\n  everything before submitting** - never submit code you don't understand\n\n### Getting Updates\n\nWhen new features are contributed and merged, users can easily get them with:\n\n```bash\n/upgrade\n```\n\nThe upgrade command intelligently merges new features while preserving your\npersonal customizations, making it easy to benefit from community contributions\nwithout losing your work.\n\n### Questions or Ideas?\n\n- Open an issue to discuss major changes before starting work\n- Join discussions in existing issues\n- Share your use cases - they help us understand needs better\n\nRemember: best practices emerge from use, not theory. Your real-world experience\nmakes this better for everyone!\n\n## Resources\n\n- [Obsidian Documentation](https://help.obsidian.md)\n- [PARA Method](https://fortelabs.com/blog/para/)\n- [Claude Code Documentation](https://claude.ai/docs)\n\n## Inspiration\n\nThis starter kit was inspired by the workflows discussed in:\n\n- [How to Use Claude Code as a Second Brain](https://every.to/podcast/how-to-use-claude-code-as-a-thinking-partner) -\n  Noah Brier's interview with Dan Shipper\n- Built by the team at [Alephic](https://alephic.com) - an AI-first strategy and\n  software partner that helps organizations solve complex challenges through\n  custom AI systems\n\n## License\n\nMIT - Use this however you want.
