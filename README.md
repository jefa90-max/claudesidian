# Claudesidian: Claude Code + Obsidian Starter Kit

Turn your Obsidian vault into an AI-powered second brain using Claude Code.

## What is this?

This is a pre-configured Obsidian vault structure designed to work seamlessly
with Claude Code, enabling you to:

- Use AI as a thinking partner, not just a writing assistant
- Organize knowledge using the PARA method
- Maintain version control with Git
- Access your vault from anywhere (including mobile)

## Quick Start

### 1. Get the Starter Kit

**Option A: Clone with Git**

```bash
# Clone with your preferred folder name (replace 'my-vault' with any name you like)
git clone https://github.com/heyitsnoah/claudesidian.git my-vault
cd my-vault

# Examples:
# git clone https://github.com/heyitsnoah/claudesidian.git obsidian-notes
# git clone https://github.com/heyitsnoah/claudesidian.git knowledge-base
# git clone https://github.com/heyitsnoah/claudesidian.git second-brain
```

**Option B: Download ZIP (no Git required)**

1. Click "Code" → "Download ZIP" on GitHub
2. Extract to your desired location
3. Open the folder in Claude Code

### 2. Run the Setup Wizard

```bash
# Start Claude Code in the directory
claude

# Run the interactive setup wizard (in Claude Code)
/init-bootstrap
```

This will:

- Install dependencies automatically
- Disconnect from the original claudesidian repository
- **Intelligently analyze** your existing vault structure and patterns
- **Import your existing Obsidian vault** safely to OLD_VAULT/ (if you have one)
- **Research your public work** for personalized context (with your permission)
- Ask you about your workflow preferences
- Create a personalized CLAUDE.md configuration
- Set up your folder structure
- Optionally configure Gemini Vision for image/video analysis
- Optionally configure Firecrawl for web research
- Initialize Git for version control

### 3. Open in Obsidian (Optional but Recommended)

- Download [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md)
- Open vault from the claudesidian folder
- This gives you a visual interface alongside Claude Code

### 4. Your First Session

Tell Claude Code:

```
I'm starting a new project about [topic].
I'm in thinking mode, not writing mode.
Please search my vault for any relevant existing notes,
then help me explore this topic by asking questions.
```

Or use one of the pre-configured commands (in Claude Code):

```
/thinking-partner   # For collaborative exploration
/daily-review       # For end-of-day reflection
/research-assistant # For deep dives into topics
```

## Folder Structure

```

└── .scripts/           # 自动化辅助脚本
```

## Key Concepts

### Thinking Mode vs Writing Mode

**Thinking Mode** (Research & Exploration):

- Claude asks questions to understand your goals
- Searches existing notes for relevant content
- Helps make connections between ideas
- Maintains a log of insights and progress

**Writing Mode** (Content Creation):

- Generates drafts based on your research
- Helps structure and edit content
- Creates final deliverables

### The PARA Method

**项目 (Projects)**: 有截止日期和明确成果

- 例如："2025年Q4营销策略"
- 在 `01_项目/` 中创建文件夹

**领域 (Areas)**: 持续进行，没有结束日期

- 例如："健康"、"财务"、"团队管理"
- 存放在 `02_领域/`

**资源 (Resources)**: 持续关注的主题

- 例如："AI 研究"、"写作技巧"
- 存储在 `03_资源/`

**归档 (Archive)**: 非活跃项目

- 已完成的项目及其成果
- 不再相关的旧笔记

## Claude Code Commands

Run with: `/[command-name]` in Claude Code

### Staying Updated with `/upgrade`

Claudesidian automatically checks for updates when you start Claude Code and
will remind you to run `/upgrade` when new features are available.

The upgrade command intelligently merges new features while preserving your
customizations:

```bash
# Preview what would be updated (recommended first)
/upgrade check

# Run the interactive upgrade
/upgrade

# Skip confirmations for safe updates (advanced)
/upgrade force
```

**What the upgrade does:**

- Creates a timestamped backup before making any changes
- Shows you diffs for each file before updating
- Preserves your personal notes and customizations
- Only updates system files (commands, agents, scripts)
- 永远不会触碰你的内容文件夹（00_收件箱、01_项目 等）
- Provides rollback capability if needed

**Safety features:**

- All your personal content is protected
- Complete backup created in `.backup/upgrade-[timestamp]/`
- File-by-file review and confirmation
- Progress tracked in `.upgrade-checklist.md`
- Can be stopped and resumed at any time

## Vision & Document Analysis (Optional)

With [Google Gemini](https://ai.google.dev/) MCP configured, Claude Code can
process your attachments directly without having to describe them. This means:

- **Direct image analysis**: Claude sees the actual image, not your description
- **PDF text extraction**: Full document text without copy-pasting
- **Bulk processing**: Analyze multiple screenshots or documents at once
- **Smart organization**: Auto-generate filenames based on image content
- **Comparison tasks**: Compare before/after screenshots, designs, etc.

**Why this matters**: Instead of describing "a screenshot showing an error
message", Claude Code directly sees and reads the error. Perfect for debugging
UI issues, analyzing charts, or processing scanned documents.

**Getting a Gemini API key:**

1. Visit [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com)
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Click "Get API key" in the left sidebar
4. Create a new API key (it's free!)
5. Set it in your environment: `export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-key-here"`

See `.claude/mcp-servers/README.md` for full setup instructions

## Web Research (Optional)

With [Firecrawl](https://www.firecrawl.dev/) configured, our helper scripts
fetch and save full web content directly to your vault. This means:

- **Full text capture**: Scripts pipe complete article text to files, not
  summaries
- **Context preservation**: Claude doesn't need to hold web content in memory
- **Batch processing**: Save multiple articles at once with `firecrawl-batch.sh`
- **Clean markdown**: Web pages converted to readable, searchable markdown
- **Permanent archive**: Your research stays in your vault forever

**Why this matters**: Instead of Claude reading a webpage and summarizing it
(losing detail), the scripts save the FULL text. Claude can then search and
analyze thousands of saved articles without hitting context limits. Perfect for
research projects, documentation archives, or building a knowledge base.

**Example workflow:**

```bash
# 保存单篇文章
npm run firecrawl:scrape -- "https://example.com/article" "03_资源/文章"

# 批量保存多个 URL
npm run firecrawl:batch -- urls.txt "03_资源/研究"
```

**Getting a Firecrawl API key:**

1. Visit [Firecrawl](https://www.firecrawl.dev) and sign up
2. Get 300 free credits to start (open-source, can self-host)
3. Go to your dashboard to find your API key
4. Copy the key (format: `fc-xxxxx...`)
5. Set it in your environment: `export FIRECRAWL_API_KEY="fc-your-key-here"`

## Helper Scripts

Run these with `pnpm`:

- `attachments:list` - Show unprocessed attachments
- `attachments:organized` - Count organized files
- `attachments:sizes` - Find large files
- `attachments:orphans` - Find unreferenced attachments
- `vault:stats` - Show vault statistics

## Advanced Setup

### Quick Launch from Anywhere

Install a shell command to launch your vault from any directory:

```bash
# In Claude Code, run:
/install-claudesidian-command
```

This creates a `claudesidian` alias that:

- Changes to your vault directory automatically
- Tries to resume your existing session (if one exists)
- Falls back to starting a new session
- Returns to your original directory when done

**Usage:**

```bash
# From anywhere in your terminal:
claudesidian

# It will automatically resume your last session or start a new one
```

The command is added to your shell config (~/.zshrc, ~/.bashrc, etc.) so it
persists across terminal sessions.

### Git Integration

Initialize Git for version control:

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial vault setup"
git remote add origin your-repo-url
git push -u origin main
```

Best practices:

- Commit after each work session
- Use descriptive commit messages
- Pull before starting work

### Mobile Access

1. Set up a small server (mini PC, cloud VPS, or home server)
2. Install Tailscale for secure VPN access
3. Clone your vault to the server
4. Use Termius or similar SSH client on mobile
5. Run Claude Code remotely

### Custom Commands

Create specialized commands by saving instructions in `.claude/commands/`:

**研究助手** (`06_元数据/代理/research-assistant.md`):

```markdown
You are a research assistant.

- Search the vault for relevant information
- Synthesize findings from multiple sources
- Identify gaps in knowledge
- Suggest areas for further exploration
```

## Tips & Best Practices

### From Experience

1. **Start in thinking mode**: Resist the urge to generate content immediately
2. **Be a token maximalist**: More context = better results
3. **Save everything**: Capture chats, fragments, partial thoughts
4. **Trust but verify**: Always read AI-generated content
5. **Break your flow**: AI helps you resume easily

## Troubleshooting

### Claude Code can't find my notes

- Make sure you're running Claude Code from the vault root directory
- Check file permissions
- Verify markdown files have `.md` extension

### Git conflicts

- Always pull before starting work
- Commit frequently with clear messages
- Use branches for experimental changes

### Attachment management

- Run `npm run attachments:create-organized` to set up folders
- Use helper scripts to find orphaned files
- Keep attachments under 10MB for Git

## Philosophy

This setup is based on key principles:

1. **AI amplifies thinking, not just writing**
2. **Local files = full control**
3. **Structure enables creativity**
4. **Iteration beats perfection**
5. **The goal is insight, not just information**

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from the community! This is a living template that gets
better with everyone's input.

### How to Contribute

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Create a feature branch** (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. **Make your changes**
4. **Test your changes** to ensure everything works
5. **Commit your changes** (`git commit -m 'Add amazing feature'`)
6. **Push to the branch** (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
7. **Open a Pull Request** with a clear description of what you've done

### What We're Looking For
